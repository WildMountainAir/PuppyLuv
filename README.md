## Introduction

 Pet lovers can search their next fur baby best matching their needs. Once a user finds a puppy, they can then reference a shelter’s web page and discover what services are offered. PuppyLuv's database of available puppies is made up of animal-care professionals and volunteers for their local animal welfare organizations all working together to maintain active and accurate homeless pet lists through [Petfinder's API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/).

## Features

A few of the things you can do with PuppyLuv:
* Search available puppies in your area
* Save puppies to your wishlist
* View puppies specific to your lifestyle
* Share puppies through your social networks or via email
<!-- * Search for and display pet listings based on pet characteristics, location, and status.
* Search for and display animal welfare organizations based on organization name, ID, and location.
* Display a random selection of available pets on a webpage; set up pages to display pets in various categories; 
* Search for adoptable pets based on a number of criteria; or display profiles of local organizations. -->

## Build Process

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- **Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`. -->
